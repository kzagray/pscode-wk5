// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

input Number1
input Number2
Sum = Number1 + Number2
	PRINT Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

input Number
IF Number % 2 == 0 THEN:
	PRINT "even"
ELSE
	PRINT "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) Create a list "Numbers" of five integers
   FOR each Number FROM 1 to 5 DO
   PRINT "Input number"
   Add inputNumber to "Numbers"

b) variable Average = (inputNumber1 + inputNumber2 + inputNumber3 + inputNumber4 + inputNumber5) % 5

c) variable "min" = large positive number
   variable "max" = large negative number
   FOR each Number FROM 1 to 5 DO
   IF inputNumber < min THEN
	min = inputNumber
   IF inputNumber > max THEN
	max = inputNumber 
		

d) PRINT "The Average of the numbers is " Average 
   PRINT "The Minimum of the numbers is " min
   PRINT "The Maximum of the numbers is " max
